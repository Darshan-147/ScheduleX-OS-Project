Hello amazing peeps! This is the Operating System Project - ScheduleX. It is based on CPU Scheduling Algorithms that include Priority Scheduling, Peterson's Solution, Optimal Page Replacement and FCFS disk scheduling algorithms. We've also provided the guide to demonstrate the working of each of the algorithms. I hope this repository helps you clear your concepts of CPU Scheduling Algorithms. Thank you.
